# hello-world
This is an example to help me get started

I have many tech/software interests and not enough time or energy to pursue them.
For now, I want to find a way to use FORTH in a Windows-10 environment so I can maintain old applications written originally under DOS in a derivation of F-83.

It has been 15 years or more since I have done any significant software or field work. I bought a Tektronix scope on Craigslist and immediately got stares the moment I took it aboard an airplane. Like Rip Van Winkle - I used to do this all the time. I guess scopes are really out of date.
